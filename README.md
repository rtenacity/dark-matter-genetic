# Searching for Dark Matter in ATLAS Proton-Proton Experiments Using Genetic Algorithms

The dark photon is a proposed model of dark matter that extends the Standard Model to add a new particle called the dark photon. The goal of this study was to investigate the plausibility of using genetic algorithms to find potential proton-proton interactions that could lead to the production of dark matter according to the dark photon model. The data that the algorithm used was by CERN in ATLAS proton-proton experiments. The algorithm ran a series of genetic algorithms that traversed the data to find interactions with a large amount of missing transverse energy (in GeV), a key indicator that dark photon production was taking place. The algorithm then took the top two clusters from each algorithm run and merged them together to create a resulting dataset. After execution, the algorithm converged on seven data points. Comparing the means of the missing transverse energy in a two-tailed t-test led to a P-value of 0.00092816, which was far less than the alpha value of 0.05. The statistical analysis suggests that the algorithm was successful in detecting potential dark photon production candidates.
